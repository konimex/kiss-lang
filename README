________________________________________________________________________

This is an (unofficial) Wyverkiss repo based on the KISS repo for
programming languages maintained by Daniel M. Matongo (@mmatongo on
GitHub).


What this repo is for
________________________________________________________________________

This repo is mainly for documentation on how to build programming
languages packages in an LLVM-only environment, and eventually the
modifications made here will be included in Wyvertux, as I have no
roadmap for Wyvertux for the time being (I don't want it to sprawl
everywhere without a clear roadmap). Also, any non-intrusive changes
will be upstreamed (i.e. any changes that would build on Wyverkiss but
would cause a regression in KISS won't be included).


DISCLAIMER
________________________________________________________________________

Since the only test I'll do is to compile the compiler itself and try
some basic things (hello world, basic arithmetics), I cannot say this is
production-ready. As always, use at your own risk, and it is better to
copy it to your personal packages and maintain it yourself rather than
relying on this repo (if you're using Wyverkiss or kiss-llvm). KISS
Linux users should not use this package, and are encouraged to use the
upstream repo instead: https://github.com/mmatongo/kiss-lang.
